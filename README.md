# Model: Machine Understanding of Cellular Life Discovery System

## Project Summary

**Model** is a computational discovery system that autonomously builds understanding of cellular life through empirical observation and experimentation. Unlike traditional models that passively represent data, this system operates as a "computational scientist" - actively generating hypotheses, designing experiments, and iteratively refining its understanding through systematic falsification.

### Why "Model"?

We call this project "Model" because we're expanding the traditional definition of what a model can be. Rather than just a passive representation of data, we've added "batteries" - intelligent scaffolding that enables the model to:
- Generate novel hypotheses about cellular phenomena  
- Design experiments to test its own predictions
- Update its understanding based on experimental results
- Systematically attempt to falsify its own discoveries

This transforms the model from a mere representation into an active participant in the scientific discovery process. In the active learning loop of scientific discovery, the **Model** sits at the critical junction between observation and experimental design - it receives observations, integrates them into its understanding, and uses that updated knowledge to design the next round of experiments. This creates a continuous discovery spiral where each cycle deepens our understanding of cellular life.

### Documentation Purpose

This document defines the scope and requirements for the **Model** project - establishing what constitutes a valid model in the development of machine understanding of cells from empirical observations. It serves as our blueprint for building a computational scientist capable of autonomous biological discovery.

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Develop a computational discovery system that autonomously builds understanding of cellular life through empirical observation and experimentation. The system operates as a "computational scientist" that generates falsifiable hypotheses, designs experiments, interprets results, and iteratively refines its understanding of biological phenomena.

```

The system operates as a continuous active learning loop where the model designs experiments, observations are made, and the model updates itself based on the results to design better experiments in the next cycle.

### 1.3 Core Philosophy
The system follows empirical scientific methodology: discoveries are considered valid only after surviving repeated attempts at falsification across multiple biological contexts. Truth is contextual - the system must identify not just what is true, but the specific contexts in which each truth applies.
